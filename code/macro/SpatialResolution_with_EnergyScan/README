This macro is intented to estimate the spatial reasolutions, both in U and V directions, 
for sensors tested in a test beam with a configuration where both DUT and telescope reference 
planes are sensors of the same type operated with the same parameters (e.g. threshold). 
This macro also extracts the beam energy, and is intended to be used for cases in which the 
beam energy is low enough that multiple scattering effects are important.

- Experimental input:
The experimental input are the measured residues taking each sensors as DUT and considering the 
rest as reference planes for tracking. Then, if in the experimental setup there are N such sensors, 
then N residudes, both on U and V directions, can be measured.

- Input from MC simulation:
Another input needed for the analysis are the residues as a function of the sensors spatial 
resolution (sigma_sp) for several values of the beam energy (Ebeam) extracted from MC. This 
information is in a format of a histogram with the residue at the DUT position as a function 
of the sensor sigma_sp. There will be one .root file containing such a histrogram for each Ebeam 
sampled value and for each senso. So, if there are N sensors and M sampled values of Ebeam, there 
will be NxM such .root files.

These set of root files are used to build a function residue_i(sigma_sp,Ebeam), where residue_i 
is the residue at expected at sensor ith. This function is built by making linear interpolation 
between the sampled poits of Ebeam and sigma_sp. This function is then used to build a chi^2 function 
for sensor ith as follows,

chi^2_i(U/V) = (residue_exp_i - residue_i(sigma_sp(U/V),Ebeam))^2/error_residue_exp_i(U/V)^2

where residue_exp_i and error_residue_exp_i are the mesured residue and its errors for sensor 
ith considered as DUT.

The set of chi^2_i(U/V) are used to build a total chi^2(U/V) as follows,

 chi^2_tot(U/V) = sum_i [chi^2_i(U/V)]

The function chi^2_tot(U/V) depends only on sigma_sp(U/V) and Ebeam. The total chi^2 is then the sum 
of the total chi^2_tot in U and V directions,

chi^2_tot = chi^2_tot(U) + chi^2_tot(V)

which depends on sigma_sp(U), sigma_sp(V) and Ebeam. This is the function to be minimized to extract 
these parameters. The minimization is performed by TMinuit of ROOT. The ouput of the code are the values 
of sigma_sp(U), sigma_sp(V) and Ebeam at the minimum with the corresponding errors and correlation matrix, 
as well as, a set of plots (.pdf file) which illustrate the method and the quality of the fit.


In order to use the code it needs to the compiled as follows,

>$ make clean
>$ make

This will create an executable called SpatialResolutionApp

It is then executed by using the executable and giving a datacard (DataCard.txt) with the all 
input informations to perform the analysis

>$ SpatialResolutionApp  DataCard.txt


The datacard file is as follows,
