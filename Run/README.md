Files can be visualised with ROOT. These are the results of the analysis for each run.  
115, 116 are alignment runs (without magnetic field) while 1210-1215 are analysis runs (with magnetic field)  
_merged121x.root_ contains the results of runs 1210, 1211, 1213, 1214, 1215 that have been merged in order to have more events
(since we cannot acquire too much data in one run with sitrineo DAQboard).
